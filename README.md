Methodology :
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles for numerical variables.
Visualization: Generate visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to explore data distributions, trends, and relationships.
Statistical Analysis: Conduct statistical tests or calculations to validate observations and identify significant patterns or correlations.
Insights and Recommendations: Summarize key findings from the analysis and provide actionable recommendations for improving sales performance and optimizing business strategies.

Conclusion :
The EDA project aims to provide valuable insights into Walmart sales data, uncovering factors influencing sales performance and identifying opportunities for enhancing business operations and decision-making.
